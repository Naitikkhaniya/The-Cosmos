            <div class="bg-black/30 p-8 rounded-2xl backdrop-blur-md shadow-lg">
                <p class="text-justify" id="first">ΛCDM (Lambda-Cold Dark Matter) is the prevailing cosmological model describing the universe's evolution.  
                    It posits that the universe is dominated by dark energy (represented by the cosmological constant, Lambda) which drives its accelerated expansion, and cold dark matter, a hypothetical form of matter that interacts gravitationally but not through light.
                    This model successfully explains various cosmological observations, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the large-scale structure of the universe, and the distances to supernovae.  
                    However, the nature of both dark matter and dark energy remains a mystery, prompting ongoing research and exploration of alternative theories.  
                    ΛCDM provides a framework for understanding the universe's past, present and future, though its fundamental constituents are still largely unknown.
                    It represents a significant milestone in our quest to unravel the cosmos.</p>

            <div class="bg-black/30 p-8 rounded-2xl backdrop-blur-md shadow-lg">
                <p class="text-justify" id="second">Inflationary cosmology proposes a period of extremely rapid, exponential expansion of the early universe, occurring fractions of a second after the Big Bang.
                    This expansion driven by a hypothetical field called the inflaton, smoothed out initial inhomogeneities and explains the observed uniformity of the cosmic microwave background.
                    Inflation also predicts the existence of primordial gravitational waves which scientists are actively searching for as evidence of this epoch.
                    Different models of inflation were being explored around 2000, each with its own predictions for the properties of the early universe.
                    Inflation provides a compelling explanation for several puzzles in standard Big Bang cosmology but its precise mechanism and connection to other fundamental physics remain open questions.
                    It remains a cornerstone of modern cosmological thought.</p>

            <div class="bg-black/30 p-8 rounded-2xl backdrop-blur-md shadow-lg">
                <p class="text-justify" id="third">String theory is a theoretical framework in physics that replaces point-like particles with one-dimensional strings, aiming to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity.
                    M-theory, discovered in the late 1990s, is a more comprehensive theory that encompasses the five consistent versions of string theory, suggesting they are different aspects of a single underlying theory.
                    Braneworld scenarios, explored within M-theory, propose that our universe is a "brane" embedded in a higher-dimensional space, potentially interacting with other branes.
                    While string theory and M-theory offer a promising path towards a "theory of everything," they are still under development, lacking direct experimental verification.
                    They remain active areas of research in theoretical physics, offering tantalizing possibilities for understanding the universe at its most fundamental level.</p>

            <div class="bg-black/30 p-8 rounded-2xl backdrop-blur-md shadow-lg">
                <p class="text-justify" id="fourth">Dark matter, comprising the vast majority of matter in the universe, interacts gravitationally but not through electromagnetic forces, making it invisible to telescopes.
                    Its existence is inferred from galactic rotation curves and other cosmological observations.
                    Around 2000, scientists were actively engaged in direct detection experiments searching for dark matter particle candidates like axions (lightweight, weakly interacting particles) and WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).
                    These experiments aim to detect the rare interactions of these particles with ordinary matter.
                    Understanding the nature of dark matter is one of the most pressing problems in modern physics, as it plays a crucial role in galaxy formation and large-scale structure in the universe.
                    The search continues with increasingly sensitive detectors and new theoretical models.</p>

                <p class="text-justify" id="fifth">High-redshift surveys observe galaxies at great distances, corresponding to earlier epochs in the universe's history.
                    The light from these galaxies has been stretched (redshifted) by the expansion of the universe.  
                    These surveys provide valuable information about the distribution of matter on large scales, galaxy formation and evolution, and the properties of the early universe.  
                    By studying these distant objects, astronomers can trace the history of cosmic structure and test cosmological models.  
                    Around 2000, these surveys were becoming increasingly sophisticated, providing crucial data for understanding the evolution of the universe and the nature of dark matter and dark energy.  
                    They continue to be a powerful tool in modern cosmology.</p>

                <p class="text-justify" id="sixth">Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful explosions in the universe, emitting intense bursts of gamma rays.  
                    They are associated with extremely energetic events, such as the collapse of massive stars (supernovae) or the merger of neutron stars.  
                    Around 2000, scientists were making significant progress in understanding the origin and nature of GRBs, using observations from space-based telescopes and ground-based observatories.  
                    These bursts provide insights into extreme physical conditions and the formation of black holes.  
                    They also serve as probes of the distant universe, allowing astronomers to study the intervening gas and galaxies.  
                    GRBs remain a topic of intense research, offering a window into some of the most cataclysmic events in the cosmos.</p>

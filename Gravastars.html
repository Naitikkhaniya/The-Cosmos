                <p class="text-justify leading-7">
                    Gravastars (Gravitational Vacuum Stars) are hypothetical objects proposed as an alternative to black holes. Introduced by Mazur and Mottola in 2001, they're Theorized To Be Extremely Dense, Like Black Holes, But Instead Of Collapsing Into a Singularity, They Have a Core Of Exotic Matter Preventing Total Collapse.

                <p class="text-justify leading-7">
                    The "gravitational vacuum" refers to the idea that the interior of a gravastar isn't empty space but a region of spacetime with extremely high vacuum energy. This high vacuum energy creates pressure balancing the inward pull of gravity, preventing collapse to a singularity.

                    A gravastar is theorized to have three layers:

                    <li><strong>The Core:</strong> The innermost region, made of exotic matter or a Bose-Einstein condensate, preventing complete collapse.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Shell:</strong> A thin layer of extremely dense matter surrounding the core.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Event Horizon (or Surface):</strong> The outermost boundary. Some models suggest gravastars might not have a true event horizon but a close approximation, a surface.</li>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Formation</h2>
            <p class="text-justify leading-7">
                The formation of a gravastar is a topic of ongoing research. One possibility is that they could form from the collapse of massive stars, similar to how black holes are thought to form. However, the exact mechanism that would lead to the formation of a gravastar instead of a black hole is not yet fully understood.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Observational Evidence</h2>
            <p class="text-justify leading-7">
                As gravastars are hypothetical objects, there is currently no direct observational evidence for their existence. However, some astronomical observations have been interpreted as potentially being consistent with the existence of gravastars. Further research and observations are needed to confirm or refute their existence.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Gravastars v/s Black Holes</h2>
            <p class="text-justify leading-7">
                Gravastars offer an intriguing alternative to black holes. While both are extremely dense objects, they differ significantly in their internal structure. Black holes are characterized by a singularity at their center, while gravastars have a core of exotic matter. This difference has implications for how these objects interact with their surroundings.
            </p>
            <p class="italic text-gray-300 leading-7">
                One of the main reasons scientists are interested in gravastars is that they could potentially resolve some of the theoretical problems associated with black holes, such as the singularity.

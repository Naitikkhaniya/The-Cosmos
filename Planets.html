            <h2 class="font-space-mono text-3xl mb-4">Definition</h2>
            <div class="bg-black/20 p-6 rounded-lg backdrop-blur-sm shadow-inner">
                <p>A planet is a celestial body that is:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
                    <li>In Orbit Around a Star</li>
                    <li>Massive Enough To Be Rounded By its Own Gravity</li>
                    <li>and has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit of other debris.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This definition adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006, has been the subject of some debate, particularly regarding the third criterion. 
                    It led to the Reclassification of Pluto as a "dwarf planet."</p>

        <div class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="font-space-mono text-3xl mb-4">Dwarf Planets</h2>
            <p>Dwarf planets meet the first two criteria of the planet definition (Orbiting a star and being rounded With Star By Gravity) But Have *not* Cleared Their Neighborhood. 
                Pluto is the most well-known example. 
                Other dwarf planets include Ceres, Eris, Haumea and Makemake.</p>

        <div class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="font-space-mono text-3xl mb-4">Exoplanets</h2>
            <p>Planets That Orbit Stars Other Than Our Sun are Called Exoplanets. Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered, and this is a very active area of astronomical research.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="font-space-mono text-3xl mb-4">Formation of Planets</h2>
            <p>Planets are thought to form from the protoplanetary disks of gas and dust that surround young stars. Over time, these materials clump together and grow through accretion, eventually forming planetesimals, then protoplanets, and finally planets.</p>
